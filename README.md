# Metosin-common

Random collection is various namespaces used in multiple Metosin projects

## Project statement

Unlike more general of our libraries (like
[compojure-api](https://github.com/metosin/compojure-api) and
[ring-swagger](https://github.com/metosin/ring-swagger)) this project is
primarily intended for use in Metosin's projects. Feel free to use, but
don't expect full support.

- We might remove features if we think they are not useful anymore
- We will reject PRs and issues about features we wouldn't use ourselves

## TODO

- [ ] Test everything
- [ ] Start using

## Ideas

- [ ] Static resources handler and middleware
- [ ] Common users, groups and logic backend and UI
- [ ] Changelog UI and generation mechanism...?
